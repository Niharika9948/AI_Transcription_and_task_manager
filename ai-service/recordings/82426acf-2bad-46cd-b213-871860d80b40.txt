 Today we are going to discuss the impact of climate change on global agriculture. Over the last few decades we have seen significant shifts in rainfall patterns. Temperature changes and increasing frequency of extreme weather events. These changes affect crop yields and food security across different regions. Now I want to everyone to pay attention to this. Please write a short summary of the lecture and submit it by next Thursday. Continuing with our discussion we will look at case studies from Africa and some tissue. In this region, farmers have adapted by changing soil, sowing dates and crop varieties. We will also analyze economic policies that support sustainable farming practices. Remember to review these supplementary material on social conservation techniques before next week's section. Far away we will discuss the role of technology in agriculture such as position, farming and AI as a state crop model. This innovative help of the wise model is introduced by the ideal foods. Make sure to complete the homework exercise on data interpretation for these case studies by tomorrow evening.
